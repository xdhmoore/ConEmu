## How to build

1. [Premake 5.0](https://premake.github.io/) is used to generate project files.

2. Visual Studio solution `src/CE.sln` is generated for ‘Visual C++ 2017’.

3. Also you may use GnuC (MinGW) and makefile_all_gcc.

   Example: `mingw32-make -f makefile_all_gcc WIDE=1`
   ! This method was tested only for x86 builds.  
   ! Tested only with ..........
   ! Still has several limitations due to lack of MinGW headers.
